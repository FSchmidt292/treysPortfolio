    <p>
        Starting off my professional life in inside sales, I've moved to a customer service role at a local software company. Ever since, I've been testing and pushing the software and I've become very interested in getting into development! I started by learning the principles of Development work and working with Sql. I've undertaken the boot camp offered by Case Western Reserve to cultivate and focus these pursuits into actual skills. Below are my working projects. I'm dedicated to learning and believe in the philosophy of hands-on learning experience, that you can't learn until you get in and get your hands dirty. This website is built from scratch to display what I am working on and, for myself, to track my progress.
